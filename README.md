## TODO
1. Find the most suitable database back-end (NoSQL)
2. Decide what to keep and what to throw directly in the garbage (instance, groups, teams, ...)
3. Syncing, front-end interface, compatibility with the old API?

## Roadmap
* DB
* Login
* Upload
* Browsing (list files, files info, ...)
* Operations (remove file, rename, copy, paste, lock, ...)
* Entities (users, groups, ...)
* Access rights
* Server infrastructure (Makefile, packages, ...)
