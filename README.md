## TODO
1. Decide what to keep and what to throw directly in the garbage (instance, groups, teams, ...)
2. Syncing, front-end interface, compatibility with the old API?
3. Security: AES?

## Roadmap
* MongoDB
* Login
* Upload
* Browsing (list files, files info, ...)
* Operations (remove file, rename, copy, paste, lock, ...)
* Entities (users, groups, ...)
* Access rights
* Server infrastructure (Makefile, packages, ...)
